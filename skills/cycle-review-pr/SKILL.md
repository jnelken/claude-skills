name: cycle-review-pr
description: Use when the current branch has an open PR, automatic code review is turned OFF, and the user wants to drive review iteratively by explicitly requesting one each round. The skill posts `@codex review` to trigger a fresh review, waits for it to land, addresses every finding, pushes, and re-triggers until the review comes back clean. Pair with `/loop`. Trigger phrases include "cycle review this PR", "request codex and address it", "keep triggering codex until clean", "review-fix-review this PR".

# Cycle Review PR

## Overview

The trigger-driven sibling of [[babysit-pr]]. `babysit-pr` assumes an automated reviewer runs on its own and *polls* for whatever shows up. This skill is for repos where **auto-review is turned off** — nothing reviews the PR until you ask. So each round it **posts `@codex review`** as a top-level PR comment to request a review, **waits** for it to land, then addresses every finding exactly as babysit-pr does (inline review threads, body-only P-badge findings, and top-level bot issue comments), commits + pushes, and **re-triggers** — looping until a freshly-requested review comes back clean.

**The core new state is "review requested, waiting."** Because you triggered the review, you must wait for it before there's anything to address — don't process a stale review from before your last push. Every round keys off `last_request_at` (when you last posted `@codex review`).

**The "resolved" state on a review thread is GraphQL-only.** `gh pr view`, REST `/pulls/{n}/comments`, and the GitHub web search all hide it. Every thread read and write below uses `gh api graphql`. If you find yourself in `gh pr view` output, you're in the wrong API.

**A clean *initial* review can be completely silent.** At least for a PR's first automatic review, some Codex configurations signal "reviewed, no findings" purely by reacting with 👍 on the PR description — no review object, no comment. Step 2 folds this into `LAST_CODEX_AT` so it isn't mistaken for "Codex hasn't answered yet." Whether a *re-triggered* review (this skill's main loop) repeats the reaction or posts a comment instead isn't confirmed — treat the reaction as one more detection surface, not the only one, and watch for the pending-review timeout misfiring if repeat clean passes turn out not to move the timestamp.

**The trigger string.** This skill posts `@codex review` — OpenAI Codex's GitHub command (`@codex` is the app, `review` is the command; a space, **not** a hyphen — GitHub parses `@codex-review` as a nonexistent *user* mention and fires nothing). It's defined once as `TRIGGER` in step 1 and referenced everywhere (the jq filters read it via `env.TRIGGER`). If your Codex app listens for a different mention, change **only that one line** — do not hardcode a string anywhere else.

## How to invoke

```
/loop /cycle-review-pr
```

No interval — let the model self-pace via `ScheduleWakeup` so it can wait for the requested review to land between iterations.

## When NOT to use

- **Auto-review is ON** — if a reviewer already runs automatically, you don't need to trigger it; use [[babysit-pr]] instead (it won't waste review runs on redundant `@codex review` requests).
- Branch has no open PR — skill exits immediately.
- Branch is `main` / `master` — abort (would never have a PR to cycle).
- Uncommitted work in the tree — the skill *will* commit and push; surface the dirty state to the user first.
- Findings require domain judgment the agent can't make (security policy, business logic) — process the mechanical ones, skip these, do not resolve them.
- User wants review run **locally before pushing** at all — that's [[peer-review]] (`/loop /peer-review`), which never touches GitHub.

## One iteration

### 1. Identify the PR

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,baseRefName,headRepositoryOwner,headRepository \
  --jq '{num:.number, url:.url, head:.headRefName, base:.baseRefName,
         owner:.headRepositoryOwner.login, repo:.headRepository.name}'
```

If `head` is `main`/`master`, abort. Cache `{owner, repo, num}` for the rest of the iteration. Set `LAST_PUSH_AT=$(TZ=UTC0 git log -1 --date=iso-strict-local --format=%cd HEAD)` — UTC (`Z`-suffixed), matching every GitHub API timestamp; git's default `%cI` emits your local offset instead, which silently breaks lexical comparisons against API data.

**Define the trigger string once, here, and reference it everywhere via `env.TRIGGER`** (gojq — which `gh --jq` uses — reads exported env vars). This is the single source of truth; change only this line to match your Codex app's mention:

```bash
export TRIGGER="@codex review"   # OpenAI Codex's GitHub command (space, not a hyphen)
```

### 2. Determine review state — trigger, wait, or process?

This step decides which of three paths the iteration takes. Compute these timestamps:

```bash
# When we last requested a review (our own top-level comment containing the trigger)
LAST_REQUEST_AT=$(gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$NUM/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains(env.TRIGGER)) | .created_at] | max // ""')

# When Codex last did anything: a review submission, a bot relay comment, or a clean-review reaction
LAST_CODEX_REVIEW_AT=$(gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$NUM/reviews \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | test("codex|chatgpt|github-actions"; "i")) | .submitted_at] | max // ""')
LAST_CODEX_COMMENT_AT=$(gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$NUM/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.type=="Bot" and (.body | contains(env.TRIGGER) | not)) | .created_at] | max // ""')
LAST_CODEX_REACTION_AT=$(gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$NUM/reactions \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.content=="+1" and (.user.login | test("codex|chatgpt"; "i"))) | .created_at] | max // ""')
```

The `test("codex|chatgpt|github-actions"; "i")` match is deliberately broad because Codex may submit as its own login *or* be relayed by `github-actions[bot]`. If your repo has **other** bots that submit PR reviews (e.g. a separate CI linter), that broad match will false-positive — one of them submitting will look like "Codex answered," routing you to Process → find nothing → wrongly declare clean. Narrow the regex to your actual Codex login if so. The reaction check uses the narrower `codex|chatgpt` (no `github-actions`) since the observed pattern is the bot reacting directly — but other bots react too (e.g. `datadog-official[bot]` commonly +1's the same PR for unrelated reasons), so confirm your repo's actual reviewer login if you widen it.

**The reaction timestamp matters most for a clean pass.** When Codex finds nothing, some configurations never create a review object or comment — only a 👍 on the PR description. Without `LAST_CODEX_REACTION_AT`, that clean pass is indistinguishable from Codex never having run, and you'd misroute to Wait until the pending-review timeout fires, or Trigger a redundant re-review.

`LAST_CODEX_AT` = the max of the three Codex timestamps (empty if Codex has never reviewed or reacted). Then branch — **check the empty cases first**, since an empty timestamp string sorts before any real one and would otherwise mis-route:

| Situation | Path |
|---|---|
| `LAST_CODEX_AT` empty **and** `LAST_REQUEST_AT` empty (nobody has reviewed or requested — truly fresh PR) | **Trigger** → jump to step 6 to post the first `@codex review`, then wait (step 7) |
| `LAST_CODEX_AT` empty **and** `LAST_REQUEST_AT` set (we asked, Codex hasn't answered yet) | **Wait** → schedule a poll (step 7), exit iteration |
| `LAST_CODEX_AT` set **and** `LAST_REQUEST_AT` set **and** `LAST_CODEX_AT` < `LAST_REQUEST_AT` (Codex hasn't answered our *latest* request yet) | **Wait** → schedule a poll (step 7), exit iteration — do NOT process a pre-request review |
| `LAST_CODEX_AT` set **and** (`LAST_REQUEST_AT` empty **or** `LAST_CODEX_AT` ≥ `LAST_REQUEST_AT`) (a review exists on the current state — e.g. a manual pre-existing review, or the one we requested) | **Process** → continue to step 3 |

The **Wait** path is what makes this skill different from babysit-pr: you asked for a review, so you must let it arrive before there's anything real to act on. Poll; don't fabricate work from a stale review. **Never route a fresh PR to Process** — with no review yet, step 3 would find nothing and you'd wrongly declare "clean" without ever triggering; the empty-`LAST_CODEX_AT` rows above prevent that.

### 3. Enumerate every finding (GraphQL threads + review bodies + issue comments)

Only reached on the **Process** path — a review has landed since your last request. Gather all three surfaces, exactly as babysit-pr does.

**a. Unresolved inline threads:**

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner:String!,$repo:String!,$num:Int!){
  repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo){
    pullRequest(number:$num){
      reviewThreads(first:100){
        nodes{
          id isResolved isOutdated
          comments(first:50){nodes{
            databaseId author{login __typename} body path line diffHunk createdAt
          }}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$REPO" -F num="$NUM"
```

Filter to threads where `isResolved == false && comments.nodes != []`. **Include `isOutdated == true` threads** — often outdated *because* a later commit already addressed them; they still deserve a reply pointing at the fix plus a resolve. Don't drop them silently.

**b. Body-only findings.** Codex often posts substantive P1/P2 findings only in the review *body* with a permalink — no inline thread. Read every review body submitted after `LAST_REQUEST_AT`:

```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$NUM/reviews \
  --jq 'map(select(.submitted_at > "'$LAST_REQUEST_AT'")) |
        map({user:.user.login, submitted:.submitted_at, body:.body})'
```

Treat any body containing a `P1/P2/P3 Badge` block (or other severity marker) as actionable even with no thread attached. A truly clean review has an empty body or just a 👍. **Body-only findings can't be resolved via `resolveReviewThread`** — no thread id; after fixing, reference the issue in the commit message and move on.

**c. Top-level bot issue comments.** `github-actions[bot]` (relaying Codex) sometimes posts findings as plain PR conversation comments — in neither query above, and with no Resolve button:

```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$NUM/comments \
  --jq 'map(select(.user.type=="Bot" and (.is_minimized|not) and .created_at > "'$LAST_REQUEST_AT'"
             and (.body | contains(env.TRIGGER) | not)))
        | map({id:.id, node_id:.node_id, user:.user.login, body:.body})'
```

The `node_id` (e.g. `IC_kwDO…`) is the GraphQL `subjectId` for `minimizeComment` in step 5. Treat any such comment containing a finding as actionable; skip pure status/noise (usage-limit notices, linkbacks, "Claude finished…" summaries) — don't minimize those.

**If all three surfaces are empty → the requested review is CLEAN.** The cycle has converged: post the summary comment (step 8), then exit `/loop` via step 7.

### 4. Plan actions — DO NOT execute yet

Read each thread's file to get current state, then build a working list — one row per finding. For outdated threads, the `line` number is stale; search the current file for what the comment refers to.

| id | kind | action | reply? | resolve/minimize? | reply_text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `T_abc` | thread | apply fix | **no** | resolve | *(none)* |
| `T_def` | thread | disagree / already handled | yes | resolve | `Not making this change because …` |
| `T_ghi` | thread | clarify | yes | **no** | `Can you clarify …?` |
| `T_jkl` | thread | skip (policy) | **no** | **no** | *(none)* |
| `IC_kwDO…` | issue comment | apply fix | **no** | minimize (`RESOLVED`) | *(none)* |

`kind` distinguishes a review thread (resolvable) from a top-level issue comment (minimizable). A top-level comment has no thread to reply into, so either fix-then-minimize, or skip-and-leave.

Decision rules:

| Situation | Action | Reply? | Resolve? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Suggestion is correct + actionable | Apply the fix | **no** | yes |
| Suggestion is wrong, low-value, or already addressed (including outdated-because-fixed) | Reply with reasoning or pointing at the fix SHA | yes | yes |
| Comment needs clarification (ambiguous, missing context) | Reply asking a specific question | yes | **no** |
| Comment requires architectural/policy/security judgment | Skip entirely | **no** | **no** |

**When a code fix is applied, no reply is needed — just resolve.** Replies are only for threads where no code change is made.

Treat human reviewer threads the same as bot threads, but raise the bar for "apply without asking": apply only if the change is mechanical or clearly correct. When in doubt, reply asking and leave unresolved.

**Do not post any replies or call any mutations during this step.** Execution happens in steps 5–6 after the push, so every reply references a real SHA.

### 5. Apply fixes and push

Apply every code fix from the working list. If there are no code fixes (only reply-only rows), skip the commit but still continue to the reply/resolve step.

When there are fixes to commit, follow the repo's commit conventions — check `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / recent `git log` first. Many repos require ticket-ID suffixes (e.g. `(CON-1234)`); reuse the ID from the PR title or the branch's first commit.

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "<message following repo convention>" && git push
NEW_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
```

If there were no code fixes, capture HEAD anyway for the reply text:

```bash
NEW_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
```

**Never** force-push, rebase, or amend — review threads anchor to specific commits and these rewrite history.

Now reply and/or resolve — **mandatory, do not skip.** Work through every row.

For rows where `reply? == yes` — post the reply first:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($id:ID!,$body:String!){
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input:{pullRequestReviewThreadId:$id, body:$body}){
    comment{id}
  }
}' -f id="$THREAD_ID" -f body="$REPLY_TEXT"
```

For rows where `resolve? == yes` — resolve the thread:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($id:ID!){
  resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{id isResolved}}
}' -f id="$THREAD_ID"
```

For top-level **issue comment** rows you addressed — minimize:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($id:ID!){
  minimizeComment(input:{subjectId:$id, classifier:RESOLVED}){
    minimizedComment{ isMinimized minimizedReason }
  }
}' -f id="$COMMENT_NODE_ID"
```

**Checklist before step 6:**
- [ ] Every thread "apply fix" row: resolved, no reply
- [ ] Every thread "disagree / already handled" row: replied + resolved
- [ ] Every thread "clarify" row: replied, NOT resolved
- [ ] Every "skip" row: no reply, no resolve, no minimize
- [ ] Every issue-comment row you fixed: minimized (`RESOLVED`)

### 6. Re-trigger the review

**Only if you pushed a code change this iteration** (step 5 produced a new commit). A re-review of unchanged code just reproduces the same findings — wasteful and loop-inducing.

```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$NUM/comments -f body="$TRIGGER"   # $TRIGGER from step 1
LAST_REQUEST_AT=$(TZ=UTC0 git log -1 --date=iso-strict-local --format=%cd HEAD)  # UTC; or capture the comment's created_at directly
```

This is also the path taken on a **fresh start** (step 2 "Trigger" case): no findings to address, no request yet → post `$TRIGGER` to kick off the first review, then wait.

If this iteration made **no code changes** (all findings were reply-only or skipped), do **not** re-trigger — there's nothing new to review. Go to step 7 and exit, surfacing the skipped items to the user.

### 7. Decide whether to continue

Under `/loop` dynamic mode: scheduling a wakeup = continue, omitting it = exit.

| State this iteration | Next |
|---|---|
| **Triggered** a review (fresh start, or re-triggered after a push) | `ScheduleWakeup(120s)` — wait for Codex to answer, then poll |
| **Waiting** (request pending, `LAST_CODEX_AT < LAST_REQUEST_AT`) | `ScheduleWakeup(120s)` — keep polling for the requested review |
| **Processed** a review that came back **clean** (all three surfaces empty) | post the summary comment (step 8) → omit `ScheduleWakeup` → exit `/loop`, report converged |
| **Processed** findings but made **no code changes** (reply-only / skipped) | post the summary comment (step 8) → omit `ScheduleWakeup` → exit `/loop`, surface skipped items to user |

State the phase in `ScheduleWakeup.reason`, e.g. `"waiting for requested codex review on abc1234"`, `"poll 2 for pending review"`.

**How to know the requested review landed.** On each wakeup, recompute `LAST_CODEX_AT` (step 2). Once it exceeds `LAST_REQUEST_AT`, a review arrived on the current state — go process it (step 3). Codex typically answers within 1–5 minutes; the 120s poll stays outside the 5-min prompt-cache TTL only on the first tick, so expect one cache miss per pending review — you're idle anyway.

```dot
digraph cycle {
  rankdir=LR;
  "state?" [shape=diamond, label="step 2 state"];
  "trigger" [shape=box, label="post @codex review\n(step 6)"];
  "wait" [shape=box, label="ScheduleWakeup(120s)\npoll for review"];
  "process" [shape=box, label="address findings\n(steps 3-5)"];
  "changed?" [shape=diamond, label="pushed a fix?"];
  "clean?" [shape=diamond, label="review clean?"];
  "exit" [shape=doublecircle, label="exit /loop"];

  "state?" -> "trigger" [label="fresh start"];
  "state?" -> "wait" [label="request pending"];
  "state?" -> "process" [label="review landed"];
  "trigger" -> "wait";
  "wait" -> "state?" [label="on wakeup"];
  "process" -> "clean?";
  "summary" [shape=box, label="post summary comment\n(step 8)"];
  "clean?" -> "summary" [label="yes"];
  "clean?" -> "changed?" [label="no (had findings)"];
  "changed?" -> "trigger" [label="yes"];
  "changed?" -> "summary" [label="no (reply-only/skipped)"];
  "summary" -> "exit";
}
```

### 8. Post a summary comment on exit — REQUIRED

Both exit paths (converged clean, or reply-only/skipped) end with a top-level PR comment summarizing the whole cycle, so the review trail is visible on the PR itself — not just in the agent transcript. Do this BEFORE ending the loop; the cycle is not complete without it.

Include:

- **Outcome**: converged clean after N rounds (and the HEAD SHA the clean pass ran on), or exited with items skipped/needing human judgment.
- **Findings addressed**: one line per finding — severity, gist, and the short SHA of the commit that fixed it. Reply-only dispositions (disagreed / already handled) get their one-line reason.
- **Skipped items**, if any, called out prominently as needing human attention.
- **CI status** at last push, and any test caveats (e.g. repos where CI runs no test job — say what was run locally).
- Anything else a human reviewer should know before merging (e.g. a mid-cycle merge from main and what was checked as a result).

```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$NUM/comments -f body="## Review cycle summary
..."
```

Keep it scannable — headline outcome first, then the per-finding list. This comment is for the humans who review/merge the PR after the loop ends; write it for someone who did not watch the rounds happen.

## Reply phrasing

Keep replies to one or two sentences. Replies are only posted when no code fix was applied.

| Outcome | Template |
|---|---|
| Disagree | `Not making this change because {one-line reason}.` |
| Out of scope | `Out of scope for this PR; tracked separately.` |
| Already handled | `Already handled at {file}:{line}.` |
| Need clarification (do not resolve) | `Can you clarify {specific question}? Want to make sure I understand before changing this.` |

## Anti-loop safeguards

- **Wasted-trigger guard.** Never post `@codex review` when HEAD hasn't changed since your last request — you'll get the same findings back forever. Re-trigger only after a real push (step 6).
- **Same-thread retry cap.** If the same `thread.id` shows up unresolved across three consecutive iterations after you've replied, stop touching it and surface to the user.
- **Reviewer ping-pong.** If a fix generates a *new* comment on the *same line*, address it once. A third comment on that line → stop and escalate.
- **Hard ceiling.** Eight trigger→process cycles without convergence → exit and report. Each cycle spends a real Codex review; don't burn them indefinitely.
- **Pending-review timeout.** If a requested review hasn't landed after ~6 poll ticks (~12 min), the trigger may have failed (wrong mention string, Codex app not installed on the repo) — **or** a clean pass landed as a reaction that isn't feeding `LAST_CODEX_AT` (verify step 2 actually queries `/issues/$NUM/reactions`). Stop and tell the user to check the trigger mention (`$TRIGGER`) and app config.

## Common mistakes

- **Processing a stale review** — the whole point of triggering is that the review must post-date your request. Always gate on `LAST_CODEX_AT ≥ LAST_REQUEST_AT` (step 2) before treating anything as a finding.
- **Re-triggering with no code change** — a fresh `@codex review` on unchanged HEAD reproduces the same findings and loops forever. Only re-trigger after a push (step 6 guard).
- **Skipping the reply/resolve step after a push** — the push is not the end; replies, resolves, and minimizes come after it, before re-triggering.
- **Posting replies during step 4** — step 4 is planning only; replies posted before the push reference a non-existent SHA.
- **Treating "no code changes" as "re-trigger anyway"** — reply-only/skipped iterations produce nothing new to review; exit instead of triggering.
- **Trusting `line` on outdated threads** — the line number is stale; read the current file before deciding whether the concern still applies.
- **Treating a review with no inline threads as automatically clean** — Codex often posts P1/P2 findings only in the review *body* or as a top-level bot comment. Check all three surfaces (step 3) before declaring convergence.
- **Ignoring reactions when computing `LAST_CODEX_AT`** — at least for an initial review, a clean pass may only show up as a 👍 on the PR description, with no review object, thread, or comment. Miss that in step 2 and a completed clean pass looks like "Codex hasn't answered yet," burning poll ticks until the pending-review timeout fires.
- **Wrong trigger string** — if Codex never answers, your mention may not match the app's configured trigger (`@codex review` with a space, **not** `@codex-review` with a hyphen, which GitHub treats as a nonexistent user mention). Fix `TRIGGER` in step 1; don't loop forever waiting.
- **Exiting without the summary comment** — reporting convergence only in the agent transcript leaves no trail on the PR for the humans who merge it. Step 8 is required on both exit paths.
- **Using this when auto-review is ON** — you'd double-review and waste runs; use [[babysit-pr]] instead.
- **Amending or force-pushing** — review threads anchor to commits; rewriting breaks them.
- **Pushing to `main`** — abort if `head == base` or branch is a default branch.
